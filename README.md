## What We Built (SWAT.AI)

We built the first version of an AI system that works like a special-ops team entering a building instead of one person walking in alone, 
multiple AI agents explore different paths at the same time, instantly share what doesn’t work, and focus together on what does.

In cybersecurity, that coordination means identifying vulnerabilities and breaking through complex defenses in seconds — problems that existing models can take hours to analyze step by step.

In our tests, this system solved a highly difficult challenge that top human hackers and standard AI models could not solve in the same time.
BECAUSE IT REFUSED TO THINK ALONE.
